Raw Damage: Non-elemental damage.

Elemental Damage (Blight): Thunder, fire, water, ice, and dragon.
                           Elemental damage that deals damage to the monster's health.

Elemental Damage (Status): Poison, paralysis, sleep, and blast.
                           Elemental damage that deals damage to the monster's status health.
                           When this health is depleted, the status effect will take place.
                           These statuses will not actually deal damage to the monster's
                           primary health.

Sharpness: Each color has a different value for both raw and elemental damage.

Raw Sharpness Multipliers:     Elemental Sharpness Multipliers:
Red:    0.50                   Red: 0.25
Orange: 0.75                   Orange: 0.50
Yellow: 1.00                   Yellow: 0.75
Green:  1.05                   Green:  1.00
Blue:   1.20                   Blue:   1.0625
White:  1.32                   White:  1.15
Purple: 1.39                   Purple: 1.25

Affinity: The player's chance to get a critical hit. By default, a critical hit deals 
          +25% raw damage. Traditionally this won't increase elemental damage, unless
          the player has the armor skill Critical Element.

Motion Value: A number given to each attack to distinguish them.
              The highter the motion value, the more powerful the attack.
                           
Monter Hitzones: Each monster part is given several numbers to distinguish how weak they
                are to certain types of damage. The higher the hitzone, the weaker the
                part is. For raw damage, a part will have raw hitzones for Sever, Blunt,
                and Bullet attacks.  For elemental damage, a part will have
                elemental hitzones for each element.

          spiribirds on hunts. The number labeled "Attack Up" represents the total
          amount of flat raw damage they will gain if they get the maximum number
          of spiribirds.       

Status Menu: The player can go into the Status Menu to see their damage after certain
             buffs have been applied (not all will be applied though).

              the Spirit Blade combo expends this, but if the lastt hit of the combo
              strikes a monster, then the gauge will change color (up to 3 times).
              the color will also change if the player counter a monster's attack
              with Iai Spirit Slash or if they land a hit with the Sakura Slash attack.

                   these modes with the meter filled, they will enter Archdemon Mode.
                   Attack then will expend the meter.

<Hunting Horn>
Infernal Melody - Attacking fills a circle meter. Once the meter is filled, the player

                  Trioo attack. Infernal Melody increases raw damage by +20%, but
                  replaces all other Attack Up song effects. The sonog lasts 20 seconds,
                  after which if another Attack Up song is still active, the player
                  will fall back to that.

<Chargeblade>
Charged Shield: If the player has any phials, they may perform the Elemental Roundslash
                attack to charge the shield. While in Axe Mode, the shield will increase
                raw damage by +10%. This damage increase will not appear in the
                Status Menu though.

            but this will not appear in the Status Menu.

Elemental Phial: +45% elemental damage.

<Insect Glaive>  
Kinsects: The player may perform the Harvest Extract and Recall attacks to gather
          kinsects from monster parts that give them several buffs.           
Red:                  Increased moveset.
Orange:               Increased defense.
White:                Increased movement speed.
Red + White:          +10% raw damage.
Red + White + Orange: +20% raw damage.

Also, some attacks will increase raw or elemental damage by a percentage, check the
Motion Value Spreadsheet for this information.

              the Red Swap Scroll. Also increases raw damage and stun damage while they 
              are using the Blue Swap Scroll. This is at the cost of constantly having
              their health drained by Qurios. But the more Quiros they have, the more 
              damage they will deal. The calculator will assume the player has all 3 Quiros.

                  health and will be amplified if they gain at least 150 health. both
                  effects last 30 seconds.

Frostcraft - Increases raw and elemental damage based on how full the Frostcraft gauge is
             when the player lands an attack. This gauge fills passivley, but its speed will
             increase when their weapon is sheathed. Note, because the levels only increase
             the number of gauges the player could fill, the calculator will ask instead how
             full the Frostcraft gauge is.
Gauge 1:  Doesn't increase damage.
Gauge 2:  +5% raw and elemental damage.
Gauge 3:  +20% raw and elemental damage.
Gauges 4: +30% raw and elemental damage.

Bloodlust - When the player contracts the Frenzy virus, their health is slowly reduced,
            but in exchange, raw damage, elemental damage and evasion increases, while
            stamina use is reduced. They also gain affinity when they recover from
            the virus, but the calculator will not include this.
Lvl 1: +10 raw damage and +5 elemental damage. +20% affinity once recovered.

Lvl 3: +20 raw damage and +10 elemental damage. +25% affinity once recovered.

Burst - Increases raw and elemental damage after the player lands multiple attacks.
        The number of attacks required to activate this skill depends on which weapon
        they use. For maximum damage, the calculator will assume the player has already
        landed the required number of attacks.
Lvl 1: +10 raw damage and +8 elemental damage.
Lvl 2: +12 raw damage and +10 elemental damage.
Lvl 3: +15 raw damage and +15 elemental damage.

              an effect that will affect other players within a certain area, including
              Hunting Horn Songs.

Stormsoul - Increases Thunder and Dragon elemental damage. Also increases any naturally
            occuring armor skills (not those gained through gems or a talisman), but
            this is not included in the calculator.
Lvl 1: +5% elemental damage.
Lvl 2: +10% elemental damage.
Lvl 3: +15% elemental damage.
Lvl 4: Increases the level of other skills by +1.
Lvl 5: Increases the level of other skills by +2.

Dragon Conversion - Increases all elemental resistances. When the player uses the Red Swap
                    Scroll, their elemental resistances are set to 0 and converted into
                    elemental damage. If they are using the Blue Swap Scroll, their elemental
                    resistances are further increased. 
                    After level 1 the Blue Swap Scroll
                    will also allow them to gain even more elemental resistances if they
                    continuoously attack a monster. 
                    To calculate the elemental damage increase in the Red Swap Scroll, the
                    sum of the player's elemental resistances is multiplied by a conversion
                    rate. If some resistances are negative, they will be ignored.

Red Scroll:                                       Blue Scroll:
Lvl 1: Conversion rate: 15% melee, 4% ranged.     Lvl 1: +3 all elemental resistances.
Lvl 2: Conversion rate: 15% melee, 4% ranged.     Lvl 2: +5 all elemental resistances. Elemental resistance gain on attacks activates.
